                            This repository contains code for detecting and bounding cells in images using Python and OpenCV. It includes scripts for image preprocessing, contour detection, and bounding box generation. It also includes a couple machine learning methods to predict which of the eight types of cancer present in the dataset is present in each image.

                        <p>
                            The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem. This variation involves a salesman's risk of infection along the route, and the program solves for the least risky path, which follows the standard formulation of weights on an undirected graph. This repository contains a parallelized solution using MPI (Message Passing Interface).
