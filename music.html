                <h2>About Gabriel Salmon</h2>
                <p>                    
                    Gabriel Salmon is a bass-baritone based in Seattle who performs with the Swedish Choir of Seattle, Epiphany Parish, and Harmonia. His vocal work spans both church music and concert repertoire throughout the Pacific Northwest.
                    
                    Previously in Minnesota, Gabriel performed with Minnesota Opera, Mixed Precipitation's Picnic Operetta, and Gilbert & Sullivan Light Opera Company. His voice is resonant and commanding, with a dark, velvety tone in the lower range that opens to a bright, clear upper register.
                    
                    Since relocating to Seattle in 2023, Gabriel has quickly integrated into the local music community. He can next be heard as the High Priest in Harmonia's upcoming performance of Mendelssohn's Die erste Walpurgisnacht on May 3rd at First Free Methodist Church.
